# Kohwi-Lab-HiC-Database
This repository provides code for the Kohwi Lab HiC Database. This database was produced for an assignment in Boston University's graduate level course BF768. The database was created to support the Kohwi Lab of Columbia University. No experimental data is provided, but the flask app and html that supported the host website are available here.

The database was produced by 4 students in Boston University's Master in Bioinformatics Program: Sydney Sorbello, Katie Kitrick, Dhruvi Joshi, and Sofiya Patra.
